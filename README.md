> Hi, my name is Abhinav Sharma and welcome to my profile.

<br>
 
#### <i>About Me</i>
 
 <p>I am an android developer from India. My first brush with computers and programming was back when I was in high school. My first language was C and after that I fell in love with programming. I like to take on challenges that make me question my learning and thus every new challenge made me a better developer.</p>
 
 <br>
 
 <p>I love to meet people and talk about various aspects of technology and where we can improve the solutions that we have today. Aside from programming my interest also lies in playing guitar. If you wanna connect, reach out to any social media mentioned above or you can also reach me through mail. ðŸ‘‡</p>
